# Mount protocol

Mission:**Building Finance first Data DAO Asset Creation and Issuance Protocol**

Vision:**Open Finance First, Open Data Second, Open AI Third**

## Contribute

Weâ€™re developing Mount, an Filecoin protocol that establishes DataDAO with algorithmically set interest rates; users and dApps will be able to earn interest on FIL and tokens, and borrow Ether and tokens to invest, use, or short-sell.

The mount contract is mainly divided into 3 parts: **deployer**, **factory**, **agency**

**deployer**: mount the passport of the protocol, only the deployer can provide the protocol to deploy NFTs

**agency**: A pool of funds, where the ERC20 tokens minted by users will be stored in the agency

**factory**: It is convenient for users who hold deployer NFTs to quickly deploy agencies and apps
